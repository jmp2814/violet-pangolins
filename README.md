## 🏫 Classroom Management App

This application is designed to help Pre-School teachers log into their respecitve classrooms and take attendance, add students, remove students, and add a photo on the student profiles to help them familiarize themselves with their students' faces. Teachers can also add notes on the students' profiles and save those notes to the database. In this project we will build and design this Classroom Management app using the MVC paradigm, create our own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.

## ✍️User Story:

```
As a PreSchool Teacher I want to be able to open and navigate a webpage
The webpage provides a login window
Once I provide my credentials, I am logged into my classroom portal
```

## 📑Acceptance Creteria:

```
Given a webpage functions properly
When I type my username/email and password
Then I can log into my classroom portal
When I am in the classroom portal
Then I am presented with a list of students in my classroom
When I click on a student name
Then I am able to add a note to the student's profile
When I click save note
Then I can see my note presisted and is saved to the student's profile
When I click on the "Add Student" button
Then I am able to provide First/Last names of the student and add them to my classroom list and database
When I want to remove a student from my classroom list
Then I can click on the "Remove Student" button
And that student is removed from my list as well as the database
```
